His illusions are so convincing, he once sold a dream to a dragon. He spends his days disguised as a mortal author, but his prose smells faintly of starlight and betrayal.",

Nevertheless, he’s been spotted slipping through misty coves at midnight, selling contraband scrolls and illegal potions to pirates, witches, and the occasional bureaucrat. He speaks seven dialects of Elvish, five of which he made up. Do not let him near your alchemy supplies.",
