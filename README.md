Exiled by her kin. Desired by an empire. Chosen by a fate she never asked for. 

Aluriel was born of the impossible union between a sea elf and a high elf, scorned by her kin, and exiled for the strange magic that she cannot tame. On the day that marks her passage into adulthood, she is cast out from Elven society. With nothing but her bow, her secrets, and the flickering spark of power she barely understands, Aluriel must carve a path through a world on the edge of collapse whilst wrestling with unseen forces that would lead her to madness. 

Accompanied by a grumpy dwarven priest and a quiet woman haunted by scars of her own, she crosses forests, deserts, borders, and belief systems. But the farther they go, the more Aluriel is drawn into ancient rivalries, forbidden magics, and whispers of a prophecy best left forgotten. 

In a land where gods are fading and empires hunger for conquest, one woman's journey may ignite a war... or something even greater. 

The Union Impossible: Part 1 - The Twilight Exiled is the first volume in a sweeping fantasy epic of forbidden love, slow burning power, and dangerous destinies. Perfect for fans of character-driven world-building, morally gray politics, and stories that simmer before they blaze. 

It is also, to the author's best knowledge, the first fantasy novel to openly acknowledge collaboration with artificial intelligence in its creation.
